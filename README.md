### Alan Wu (ajw238) | Eric Lin (esl89) | JuHee Lee (jl2755)

This project aims to try and use exisiting data on Airbnb listings in order to create fair prices for Airbnb listings across the world, by taking into account numerous factors. We believe that with a better way to place prices on listings, hosts and guests alike will be happier with the market overall.
